  <h1>&ldquo;Women photographers? It’ll be a short book&rdquo;</h1>
  <span class="subtitulos">He was wrong. The book was substantial in size (271 pages) and in the number of women photographers featured in its pages (more than 40).</span>

<h2>To be fair, he might be forgiven for thinking the way he did. The tally of women photographers at National Geographic, as at other magazines, has always trailed that of men. Fortunately, the gap has narrowed since the first woman, Kathleen Revis, was put on the photographic staff in 1953 (more about her later.)

Unsurprisingly, parity was slow in coming. After Revis it would be 21 years until the next woman, Bianca Lavies, made her appearance on staff, followed three years later by Jodi Cobb (featured in the upcoming “Women of Vision” exhibit).

In fact, the work of women photographers had appeared in fits and starts in the magazine long before Revis, through over-the-transom solicitations. There was, for example, Dorothy Hosmer, who had quit her job as a secretary, paid $89 for a third-class steamer ticket, and set off for a trip around the world.”</h2>

    <h1><a href="">A pristine, medieval landscape in Europe</a></h1>
    <h2>Effendi explained: “While I was on assignment for Nat Geo in Romania I first went to the region of Miercurea Ciuc … It was a nice area and the people were wonderful, but while I was there for about a week, I felt that photographically it was not working out. A lot was missing picture-wise … I was looking for a more pristine, medieval landscape in Europe and I heard that it was still preserved somewhere in Transylvania. So I decided to look for a different location. I was feeling a bit desperate for having started my assignment in the wrong place, so I literally googled two words: Transylvania Hay. And Kathleen’s book and her work on Maramures came up in the search. So I wrote her immediately and she was kind enough to respond and confirm my expectations that what I am looking for actually exists in Maramures, a more remote and isolated area in the Carpathian Mountains … I was happy and lucky to have found Maramures through Kathleen’s eyes. Although I never worked with Kathleen and never met her personally, while I was travelling around small villages in Maramures, I kept bumping into people who had known Kathleen (she had spent a few years in the area). People there are very hospitable and do not forget their visitors, especially those who come back.”
